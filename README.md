Former Restaurant General Manager following my dream to become a software developer. I am looking for a role which will challenge me and help me gain expertise in the industry so that I can work towards a more senior/leadership role.

I have had a passion for tech all my life. What made me want to become a software developer was starting a small business with my friend. With no previous experience, I took on the role as developer to successfully create over fifteen shop designs and templates for eBay businesses using HTML5 and CSS3.

#### Problem Solving

Problem solving has been a huge part of my success as it has been essential in the fast paced industry I have worked in. Managing a restaurant comes with daily problems that are unexpected and unpredictable. The reason I have been successful in this industry is due to being able to think quickly on my feet without panicking, whether it was dealing with an upset customer, the POS system breaking down or food deliveries not being delivered on the busiest weekend of the year. I believe this will be a key skill in my role as a software developer.

- Primary point of contact for conflict resolution via phone, e-mail or in person
- Critical thinking in highly stressful situations
- POS system and networking problem diagnosis and solution

#### Leadership and Communication

I take pride in my people skills, which I have gained during ten years of managing and mentoring people. I have learnt to treat all people with respect and to maintain a very positive attitude. I intend to bring these skills into a development role by helping and motivating my team in times of stress.  

- Training and development of lower and senior staff
- Great understanding of all roles in a business
- Public speaking

#### Ability to Learn

I am adaptable and flexible, I do not get easily frustrated, and grasp new concepts and assignments quickly. I have proven this through learning 3 new programming languages with their testing framework counterparts in 16 weeks. I enjoy taking on new challenges and understand my own weaknesses and what I need to do to improve them.
