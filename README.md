I'm a former Restaurant General Manager who is looking to kickstart my career in development. I am a natural leader, quick thinking problem solver and very calm and controlled in my work.I have had a passion for tech all my life. I'm looking for a role which will challenge me and help me gain expertise in the industry so i can work towards a more senior/leadership role. 

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Problem Solving 

Problem Solving has been a huge part of my success as it has been essential in the fast pace industry i have worked in. Managing a Restaurant comes with daily problems that are unexpected and unpredictable. The reason i have been successful in this industry is due to being able to think quickly on my feet without panicing, wether it be dealing with a upset customer, POS systems breaking down or food deliveries not being delivered on the busiest weekend of the year. I believe this will be a key skill 

- Primary point of contact for conflict resolution via phone, e-mail and in person
- Critical thinking in highly stressful situations
- POS system and Networking problem diagnosis and solution

#### Leadership and Communication

I take pride in my people skills and have gained over ten years experience in managing and mentoring people. I have learnt to treat all people with respect and to have a very positive attitude regardless of how i feel, when you are responsible for a team they mimic your attitude and leadership is all about showing people the way through training and support. I intend to bring these skills into a development role by helping and motivating my team in times of stress.  

- Two
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)

- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
